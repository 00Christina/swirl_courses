  Output: To see this in action, we've copied some code from the slides and created the function coinPlot. It takes an integer n which is the number of coin tosses that will be simulated. As coinPlot does these coin flips it computes the cumulative sum (assuming heads are 1 and tails 0), but after each toss it divides the cumulative sum by the number of flips performed so far. It then plots this value for each of the k=1...n tosses. Try it now for n=10. 
  CorrectAnswer: coinPlot(10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='coinPlot(10)')
  Hint: Type coinPlot(10) at the command prompt.
