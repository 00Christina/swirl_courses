- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we'll introduce basic ideas of probability, the study of quantifying the likelihood of certain events occurring. Note the similarity between the words probability and probably. Every time you use the latter word you're implying that an event is more likely than not to occur.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The first step in understanding probability is to consider an experiment and all its possible outcomes. For instance, if you were rolling a single, fair die once, how many outcomes are possible?
  AnswerChoices: 6; 1; 4; Too many
  CorrectAnswer: 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='6')
  Hint: How many sides or faces does a die (or any cube or box) have?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The probability of a particular outcome of an experiment is the ratio of the number of ways that outcome can occur to all possible outcomes of the experiment. Since there are 6 possible outcomes to the experiment of rolling a die, and we assume the die is fair, each outcome is equally likely. So what is the probability of rolling a 2?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 2/6; 1/3; 0
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: The '2' is one of six possibilities.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the probability of rolling an even number?
  AnswerChoices: 1/2; 1/3; 0; 1
  CorrectAnswer: 1/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/2')
  Hint: Half of the outcomes are even and half are odd. There are three even outcomes (2,4, and 6) and three odd (1,3, and 5)

- Class: text
  Output: Since the probability of a particular outcome or event E is the ratio of ways that E could occur to the number of all possible events, the probability of E, denoted P(E), is always between 0 and 1. Impossible events have a probability of 0 (since they can't occur) and events that are certain to occur have a probability of 1. 

- Class: text
  Output: If you're doing an experiment with n possible outcomes, say e1, e2, ..., en, then the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1. If all the outcomes are possible, as in the case of a fair die, then the probability of each is 1/n. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now consider the experiment of rolling 2 dice, one red and one green. Assume the dice are fair and not loaded. How many distinct outcomes are possible?
  AnswerChoices: 36; 12; 11; 1
  CorrectAnswer: 36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='36')
  Hint: Each of the dice has 6 ways to land, and their outcomes are independent of each other. Each way the red die lands can be paired with each way the green die lands. For instance, a "1" on the red dice can occur independently of any of the 6 outcomes of the green dice. 

- Class: text
  Output: If an event E can occur in more than one way and these ways are disjoint (mutually exclusive) then P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of each of the ways in which it can occur. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Rolling these two dice, what's the probability of rolling a 10?
  AnswerChoices: 3/36; 2/36; 1/6; 0
  CorrectAnswer: 3/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3/36')
  Hint: Since the highest possible dice roll is a '6', the only combinations which give '10' are 4+6 and 5+5. The first occurs in two ways - red dice gets '4' and green gets '6' OR red gets '6' and green gets '4'. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the most likely outcome rolling these two dice?
  AnswerChoices: 7; 2; 12; 9; 1
  CorrectAnswer: 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='7')
  Hint: The choice of '1' is impossible rolling two dice, and '2' and '12' each occur in only one possible way (snake-eyes and double 6's, respectively), so '7' and '9' are the only reasonable choices. To roll '7' you can use any number from '1' to '6', while '9' can only use outcomes of '3' and above.  

- Class: text
  Output: The probability of at least one of two events, A and B, occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of their intersection. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A&B). It's easy to see why this is. Calculating both P(A) and P(B) counts outcomes that are in both A and B twice, so the probability of the intersection of the two events, denoted as A&B, must be subtracted from the sum.

- Class: text
  Output: It follows that if A and B are disjoint or mutually exclusive, i.e. only one of them can occur, then  P(A U B) = P(A)+P(B) .

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following expressions represents the probability of rolling a number greater than 10?
  AnswerChoices: (2+1)/36; (1+1)/36; (3+1)/36; (3+1-1)/36
  CorrectAnswer: (2+1)/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/12')
  Hint: The only outcomes greater than 10 are 11 and 12 which are mutually exclusive. The first, 11, can occur in two ways, and the second, 12, can occur only with a roll of double 6's.   

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Using the answer to the previous question and the fact that the sum of all outcomes must sum to 1 to determine the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 10.
  CorrectAnswer: 11/12
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=11/12)
  Hint: Subtract the previous answer from 1.



- Class: text_question
  Output: From the boxplot, which spray has the largest median?
  CorrectAnswer: B
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='B')
  Hint: The median of each spray is indicated by the thick horizontal line in each box. Which spray has its median furthest from 0?


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now look at the summary of the linear model all.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(all)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(all)')
  Hint: Type "summary(all)" at the R prompt.



- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now generate the summary of another linear model (don't store it in a new variable) in which Fertility depends only on agriculture.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, swiss))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, swiss))')
  Hint: Type "summary(lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, swiss))" at the R prompt.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now check your intuition with the R command "cor". This computes the correlation between Examination and Education. 
  CorrectAnswer: cor(swiss$Examination,swiss$Education)
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('cor(swiss$Examination,swiss$Education)','cor(swiss$Education,swiss$Examination)')
  Hint: Type "cor(swiss$Examination,swiss$Education)" at the R prompt.



- Class: cmd_question  
  Output: Now run the function makelms() to see how the addition of variables affects the coefficient of Agriculture in the models.
  CorrectAnswer: makelms()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='makelms()')
  Hint: Type "makelms()" at the R prompt.


- Class: cmd_question  
  Output: Now we'll show what happens when we add a variable that provides no new linear information to a model. Create a variable ec that is the sum of swiss$Examination and swiss$Catholic.
  CorrectAnswer: ec <- swiss$Examination+swiss$Catholic
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('ec <- swiss$Examination+swiss$Catholic','ec <- swiss$Catholic+swiss$Examination')
  Hint: Type "ec <- swiss$Examination+swiss$Catholic" at the R prompt.



- Class: cmd_question  
  Output: Subtract the efit coefficients from the coefficients of the first model you created, all.
  CorrectAnswer: all$coefficients - efit$coefficients
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='all$coefficients - efit$coefficients')
  Hint: Type "all$coefficients-efit$coefficients" at the R prompt.
