  Output: Given the title of this lesson, what do you think it will cover?
  AnswerChoices: Common Distributions; Rare Distributions; Common Bistros; I haven't a clue 
  CorrectAnswer: Common Distributions
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Common Distributions')
  Hint: Part of the title is an abbreviation for another word we've seen several times in earlier lessons.

- Class: text
  Output: The first distribution we'll examine is the Bernoulli and it's associated with experiments which have only 2 possible outcomes. These are also called (by people in the know) binary trials.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: It might surprise you to learn that you've probably had experience with Bernoulli trials. Which of the following would be a Bernoulli trial?
  AnswerChoices: Drawing a card from a deck; Tossing a die; Flipping a coin; Spinning a roulette wheel
  CorrectAnswer: Flipping a coin
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Flipping a coin')
  Hint: Which of the choices has only two possible outcomes?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For simplicity, we usually say that Bernoulli random variables take only the values 1 and 0. Suppose we also specify that the probability that the Bernoulli outcome of 1 is p. Given what you know about probabilities, how would you specify the probability of a 0 outcome?
  CorrectAnswer: 1-p
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('1-p','-p+1')
  Hint: Recall that the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If the probability of a 1 is p and the probability of a 0 is 1-p which of the following represents the PMF of a Bernoulli distribution? Recall that the PMF is the function representing the probability that X=x.
  AnswerChoices: p^x * (1-p)^(1-x); p^(1-x) *(1-p)*(1-x); p*(1-p); x*(1-x)
  CorrectAnswer: p^x * (1-p)^(1-x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p^x * (1-p)^(1-x)')
  Hint: When x=1, which of the given expressions yields p?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Recall the definition of the expectation of a random variable. Suppose we have a Bernoulli random variable and, as before, the probability it equals 1 is p and probability it equals 0 is 1-p. What is its mean?
  CorrectAnswer: p
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p')
  Hint: Add the two terms x*p(x) where x equals 0 and 1 respectively.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Given the same Bernoulli random variable above, which of the following represents E(X^2)
  AnswerChoices: p(1-p); p^2; (1-p)^2; p; 1-p 
  CorrectAnswer: p
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p')
  Hint: Add the two terms x^2*p(x) where x equals 0 and 1 respectively.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Use the answers of the last two questions to find the variance of the Bernoulli random variable. Recall Var = E(X^2)-(E(X))^2
  AnswerChoices: p(1-p); p^2-p; p(p-1); p^2*(1-p)^2 
  CorrectAnswer: p(1-p)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p(1-p)')
  Hint: E(X^2)=p and E(X)=p, so Var=p-p^2. Rewrite this expression by factoring out the p.

- Class: text
  Output: If we let X be a Bernoulli random variable, it is typical to call X=1 as a "success" and X=0 as a "failure". After all, 1 is greater than 0, no?

- Class: text
  Output: The binomial random variables are obtained as the sum of iid Bernoulli trials.  Specifically, let X_1, ..., X_n be iid Bernoulli(p) random variables; then X = X+1 + X_2 + ... X_n is a binomial random variable. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The PMF of this binomial random variable X is the function representing the probability that X=x. Which of the following represents the PMF? Assume x goes from 0 to n and that C(n,x) represents the binomial coefficient 'n choose x'.
  AnswerChoices: C(n,x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x); C(n,x) * p^(n-x) * (1-p)^x; p^x; C(n,x) * p*x*(1-p)*(1-x)
  CorrectAnswer: C(n,x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='C(n,x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)')
  Hint: To take the value x, the random variable X must have x 'successes'. Each of these occurs with probability p. It also must have n-x 'failures', each of which occurs with probability (1-p). We don't care about the order in which the successes and failures occur.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Suppose we were going to flip a biased coin 5 times. The probability of tossing a head is .8 and a tail .2. What is the probability that you'll toss at least 3 heads.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.94208
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(0.94208)
  Hint: You'll have to add together 3 terms each of the form, C(5,x)*(.8)^x*(.2)(5-x) for x=3,4,5 . 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now you can verify your answer with the R function pbinom. The quantile is 2, the size is 5, the prob is .8 and the lower.tail is FALSE. Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: pbinom(2,size=5,prob=.8,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pbinom(2,size=5,prob=.8,lower.tail=FALSE)')
  Hint: Type pbinom(2,size=5,prob=.8,lower.tail=FALSE) at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: Another very common distribution is the normal or Gaussian. It has a complicated density function involving its mean mu and variance sigma^2. The key fact of the density formula is that when plotted, it forms a bell shaped curve, symmetric about its mean mu. The variance sigma^2 represents the width of the bell, the higher the variance, the fatter the bell.

- Class: text
  Output: We denote a normally distributed random variable X as X ~ N(mu, sigma^2). When mu = 0 and sigma = 1 the resulting distribution is called the standard normal distribution and it is often labeled Z.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's a picture of a standard normal distribution. It's centered at its mean 0 and the vertical lines represent the standard deviations.
  Figure: plotNormal.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output:  Approximately 68%, 95% and 99% of the normal density lie within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations from the mean, respectively. These are shown in the three shaded areas of the figure. For example, the darkest portion (between -1 and 1) represents 68% of the area.
  Figure: stddev1.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using the default values for all the arguments except probability, the R function qnorm(prob) returns the value of x (quantile) for which the area under the standard normal distribution to the left of x equals the parameter prob. (Recall that the entire area under the curve is 1.) Use qnorm now to find the 10th percentile of the standard normal. Remember the argument must be between 0 and 1.
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(.10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(.10))')
  Hint: Type qnorm(.1) at the R prompt.

- Class: figure
  Output:  We'll see this now by drawing the vertical line at the quantile.
  Figure: plotQuantile.R
  FigureType: new

  - Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following would you expect to be the quantile of the first (1) percentile?
  AnswerChoices: -2.33; -1.0; 0; 2.33; -1.28
  CorrectAnswer: -2.33
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='-2.33')
  Hint: Since 1 is smaller than 10 the quantile for 1 percentile should be smaller than the quantile for 10 percentile.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the quantile for 50 percentile?
  CorrectAnswer: 0
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(0)
  Hint: Type qnorm(.5) at the R prompt.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: We can use the symmetry of the bell curve to determine other quantiles. Given that 2.5% of the area under the curve falls to the left of x=-1.96, what is the quantile of the 97.5 percentile for the standard normal?
  AnswerChoices: 1.96; 2.33; -1.28; 2
  CorrectAnswer: 1.96
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1.96')
  Hint: 2.5% of the area falls to the right of the quantile of the 97.5 percentile.

- Class: text
  Output: Here are two useful facts concerning normal distributions. If X is a normal random variable with mean mu and variance sigma^2, i.e., X ~ N(mu,sigma^2),

- Class: text
  Output: then the random variable Z defined as Z = (X -mu)/sigma is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, i.e., Z ~ N(0, 1). (Z is standard normal.)

- Class: text
  Output: The converse is also true. If Z is standard normal, i.e., Z ~ N(0,1), then  the random variable X defined as  X = mu + sigma*Z is normally distributed with mean mu and variance sigma^2, i.e., X ~ N(mu, sigma^2) 

- Class: text
  Output: These formulae allow you to easily compute percentiles and quantiles for ANY normally distributed variable if you know its mean and variance. We'll show how to find the quantile of the 97.5th percentile of a normal distribution with mean 2 and variance 4.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Again, we can use R's qnorm function and specify the mean and standard deviation (the square root of the variance). Do this now. Find the quantile of the 97.5th percentile of a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 2.
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(.975,mean=3,sd=2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(.975,mean=3,sd=2)')
  Hint: Type qnorm(.975,mean=3,sd=2) at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check it using the formula above X = mu + sigma*Z. Here we'll use the quantile for the 97.5th percentile as Z. Recall that we previously inferred that this is 1.96. Let's multiply that by the standard deviation and add the mean to see if we get the same result as qnorm. 
  CorrectAnswer: 6.92
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(6.92)
  Hint: Type 1.96*2 + 3 at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Suppose you have a normal distribution with mean 1020 and standard deviation of 50. You want to compute the probability that x > 1200? The easiest way to do this is to use R's pnorm function in which you specify the quantile (1200), the mean (1020) and standard deviation (50). You also must specify that the lower.tail is FALSE since we're asking for a probability that the random variable is greater than our quantile. Do this now.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(1200,mean=1020,sd=50,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pnorm(1200,mean=1020,sd=50,lower.tail=FALSE)')
  Hint: Type pnorm(1200,mean=1020,sd=50,lower.tail=FALSE) at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Alternatively, we could compute the number of standard deviations the specified number is from the mean using the formula Z = (X -mu)/sigma. This is our new quantile. We then can use the standard normal distribution and hence the default values of pnorm. Remember to specify that lower.tail is FALSE.  Do this now.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm((1200-1020)/50,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pnorm((1200-1020)/50,lower.tail=FALSE)')
  Hint: Type pnorm((1200-1020)/50,lower.tail=FALSE) at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For practice, using the same distribution, find the quantile for the 75% percentile. Use qnorm and specify the probability (.75), the mean (1020) and standard deviation (50). Since we're want to include the left part of the curve we can use the default lower.tail=TRUE.
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(.75,mean=1020,sd=50)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(.75,mean=1020,sd=50)')
  Hint: Type qnorm(.75,mean=1020,sd=50) at the R prompt.
