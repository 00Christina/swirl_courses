  Output: Given the title of this lesson, what do you think it will cover?
  AnswerChoices: Common Distributions; Rare Distributions; Common Bistros; I haven't a clue 
  CorrectAnswer: Common Distributions
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Common Distributions')
  Hint: Part of the title is an abbreviation for another word we've seen several times in earlier lessons.

- Class: text
  Output: The first distribution we'll examine is the Bernoulli and it's associated with experiments which have only 2 possible outcomes. These are also called (by people in the know) binary trials.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: It might surprise you to learn that you've probably had experience with Bernoulli trials. Which of the following would be a Bernoulli trial?
  AnswerChoices: Drawing a card from a deck; Tossing a die; Flipping a coin; Spinning a roulette wheel
  CorrectAnswer: Flipping a coin
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Flipping a coin')
  Hint: Which of the choices has only two possible outcomes?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For simplicity, we usually say that Bernoulli random variables take only the values 1 and 0. Suppose we also specify that the probability that the Bernoulli outcome of 1 is p. Given what you know about probabilities, how would you specify the probability of a 0 outcome?
  CorrectAnswer: 1-p
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('1-p','-p+1')
  Hint: Recall that the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If the probability of a 1 is p and the probability of a 0 is 1-p which of the following represents the PMF of a Bernoulli distribution? Recall that the PMF is the function representing the probability that X=x.
  AnswerChoices: p^x * (1-p)^(1-x); p^(1-x) *(1-p)*(1-x); p*(1-p); x*(1-x)
  CorrectAnswer: p^x * (1-p)^(1-x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p^x * (1-p)^(1-x)')
  Hint: When x=1, which of the given expressions yields p?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Recall the definition of the expectation of a random variable. Suppose we have a Bernoulli random variable and, as before, the probability it equals 1 is p and probability it equals 0 is 1-p. What is its mean?
  CorrectAnswer: p
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p')
  Hint: Add the two terms x*p(x) where x equals 0 and 1 respectively.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Given the same Bernoulli random variable above, which of the following represents E(X^2)
  AnswerChoices: p(1-p); p^2; (1-p)^2; p; 1-p 
  CorrectAnswer: p
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p')
  Hint: Add the two terms x^2*p(x) where x equals 0 and 1 respectively.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Use the answers of the last two questions to find the variance of the Bernoulli random variable. Recall Var = E(X^2)-(E(X))^2
  AnswerChoices: p(1-p); p^2-p; p(p-1); p^2*(1-p)^2 
  CorrectAnswer: p(1-p)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='p(1-p)')
  Hint: E(X^2)=p and E(X)=p, so Var=p-p^2. Rewrite this expression by factoring out the p.

- Class: text
  Output: If we let X be a Bernoulli random variable, it is typical to call X=1 as a "success" and X=0 as a "failure". After all, 1 is greater than 0, no?

- Class: text
  Output: The binomial random variables are obtained as the sum of iid Bernoulli trials.  Specifically, let X_1, ..., X_n be iid Bernoulli(p) random variables; then X = X+1 + X_2 + ... X_n is a binomial random variable. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The PMF of this binomial random variable X is the function representing the probability that X=x. Which of the following represents the PMF? Assume x goes from 0 to n and that C(n,x) represents the binomial coefficient 'n choose x'.
  AnswerChoices: C(n,x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x); C(n,x) * p^(n-x) * (1-p)^x; p^x; C(n,x) * p*x*(1-p)*(1-x)
  CorrectAnswer: C(n,x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='C(n,x) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)')
  Hint: To take the value x, the random variable X must have x 'successes'. Each of these occurs with probability p. It also must have n-x 'failures', each of which occurs with probability (1-p). We don't care about the order in which the successes and failures occur.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Suppose we were going to flip a biased coin 5 times. The probability of tossing a head is .8 and a tail .2. What is the probability that you'll toss at least 3 heads.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.94208
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(0.94208)
  Hint: You'll have to add together 3 terms each of the form, C(5,x)*(.8)^x*(.2)(5-x) for x=3,4,5 . 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now you can verify your answer with the R function pbinom. The quantile is 2, the size is 5, the prob is .8 and the lower.tail is FALSE. Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: pbinom(2,size=5,prob=.8,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pbinom(2,size=5,prob=.8,lower.tail=FALSE)')
  Hint: Type pbinom(2,size=5,prob=.8,lower.tail=FALSE) at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: Another very common distribution is the normal or Gaussian. It has a complicated density function involving its mean mu and variance sigma^2. The key fact of the density formula is that when plotted, it forms a bell shaped curve, symmetric about its mean mu. The variance sigma^2 represents the width of the bell, the higher the variance, the fatter the bell.

- Class: text
  Output: We denote a normally distributed random variable X as X ~ N(mu, sigma^2). When mu = 0 and sigma = 1 the resulting distribution is called the standard normal distribution and it is often labeled Z.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's a picture of a standard normal distribution. It's centered at its mean 0 and the vertical lines represent the standard deviations.
  Figure: plotNormal.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: Here are two useful facts concerning normal distributions. If X is a normal random variable with mean mu and variance sigma^2, i.e., X ~ N(mu,sigma^2),

- Class: text
  Output: then the random variable Z defined as Z = (X -mu)/sigma is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, i.e., Z ~ N(0, 1). (Z is standard normal.)

- Class: text
  Output: The converse is also true. If Z is standard normal, i.e., Z ~ N(0,1), then  the random variable X defined as  X = mu + sigma*Z is normally distributed with mean mu and variance sigma^2, i.e., X ~ N(mu, sigma^2) 

- Class: text
  Output: These formulae allow you to easily compute percentiles for ANY normally distributed variable if you know its mean and variance. 

- Class: figure
  Output: Consider this plot again and recall our previous discussions of areas under curves (density functions) and their relationships to probabilities. The area under the entire curve is 1, right? For normally distributed variables, 68% of the area lies within 1 standard deviation

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Back to our dice example. Which of the following expressions represents P(A&B), where A is the event of rolling a 3 and B is the event of the roll being odd?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 1/2; 1/3; 1/4; 1 
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: Here A is a subset of B so the probability of both A AND B happening is the probability of A happening. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Continuing with the same dice example. Which of the following expressions represents P(A&B)/P(B), where A is the event of rolling a 3 and B is the event of the roll being odd?
  AnswerChoices: (1/6)/(1/2); (1/2)/(1/6); (1/3)/(1/2); 1/6 
  CorrectAnswer: (1/6)/(1/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='(1/6)/(1/2)')
  Hint: Here A is a subset of B so the probability of both A AND B happening is the probability of A happening. The probability of B is the reciprocal of the number of odd numbers between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

- Class: text
  Output: From the definition of P(A|B), we can write P(A&B) = P(A|B) * P(B), right?  Let's use this to express P(B|A).

- Class: text
  Output: P(B|A) = P(B&A)/P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B)/P(A). This is a simple form of Bayes' Rule which relates the two conditional probabilities.

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we don't know P(A) itself, but only know its conditional probabilities, that is, the probability that it occurs if B occurs and the probability that it occurs if B doesn't occur. These are  P(A|B) and P(A|~B), respectively. We use ~B to represent B complement. 

- Class: text
  Output: We can then express P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B) and substitute this is into the denominator of Bayes' Formula. 

- Class: text
  Output: P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / ( P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B) ) 

- Class: text
  Output: Bayes' Rule has applicability to medical diagnostic tests. We'll now discuss the example of the HIV test from the slides. 

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we know the accuracy rates of the test for both the positive case (positive result when the patient has HIV) and negative (negative test result when the patient doesn't have HIV). These are referred to as test sensitivity and specificity, respectively.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let 'D' be the event that the patient has HIV, and let '+' indicate a positive test result and '-' a negative. What information do we know?
  AnswerChoices: P(+|D) and P(-|~D); P(+|~D) and P(-|~D); P(+|~D) and P(-|D); P(+|D) and P(-|D)
  CorrectAnswer: P(+|D) and P(-|~D)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(+|D) and P(-|~D)')
  Hint: The clue here is accuracy. The test is positive when the patient has the disease and negative when he doesn't.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose a person gets a positive test result and comes from a population with a HIV prevalence rate of .001. We'd like to know the probability that he really has HIV. Which of the following represents this?
  AnswerChoices: P(+|D); P(D|+);P(~D|+); P(D|-)
  CorrectAnswer: P(D|+)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(D|+)')
  Hint: We've already been given the information that the test was positive '+'. We want to know whether D is present given the positive test result.

- Class: text
  Output: By Bayes' Formula,   P(D|+) = P(+|D) * P(D) / ( P(+|D) * P(D) + P(+|~D) * P(~D) )

- Class: text
  Output: We can use the prevalence of HIV in the patient's population as the value for P(D). Note that since P(~D)=1-P(D) and  P(+|~D) = 1-P(-|~D) we can calculate P(D|+). In other words, we know values for all the terms on the right side of the equation. Let's do it!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Disease prevalence is .001. Test sensitivity is 99.7% and specificity is 98.5%. First compute the numerator, P(+|D)*P(D). (This is also part of the denominator.)
  CorrectAnswer: .997*.001
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('.997*.001','.001*.997')
  Hint: Multiply the test sensitivity by the prevalence.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now solve for the remainder of the denominator, P(+|~D)*P(~D).
  CorrectAnswer: (1-.985)*(1-.001)
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(.014985)
  Hint: Multiply the complement of test specificity by the complement of prevalence.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now put the pieces together to compute the probability that the patient has the disease given his positive test result.
  CorrectAnswer: .000997/(.000997+.014985)
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(.06238268)
  Hint: Divide (.997*.001) by (.997*.001 + .015*.999)

- Class: text
  Output: So the patient has a 6% chance of having HIV given this positive test result. The expression P(D|+) is called the positive predictive value. Similarly, P(~D|-), is called the negative predictive value, the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The diagnostic likelihood ratio of a positive test, DLR_+, is the ratio of the two + conditional probabilities, one given the presence of disease and the other given the absence. Specifically, DLR_+ = P(+|D) / P(+|~D). Similarly, the DLR_- is defined as a ratio. Which of the following do you think represents the DLR_-?
  AnswerChoices: P(-|D) / P(-|~D); P(+|~D) / P(-|D);P(-|D) / P(+|~D); I haven't a clue.
  CorrectAnswer: P(-|D) / P(-|~D)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(-|D) / P(-|~D)')
  Hint: The signs of the test in both the numerator and denominator have to agree as they did for the DLR_+.

- Class: text
  Output:  Recall that P(+|D) and P(-|~D), (test sensitivity and specificity respectively) are accuracy rates of a diagnostic test for the two possible results. They should be close to 1 because no one would take an inaccurate test, right? Since DLR_+ = P(+|D) / P(+|~D) we recognize the numerator as test sensitivity and the denominator as the complement of test specificity. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Since the numerator is close to 1 and the denominator is close to 0 do you expect DLR_+ to be large or small?
  AnswerChoices: Large; Small; I haven't a clue.
  CorrectAnswer: Large
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Large')
  Hint: What happens when you divide a large number by a much smaller one?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now recall that DLR_- = P(-|D) / P(-|~D). Here the numerator is the complement of sensitivity and the denominator is specificity. From the arithmetic and what you know about accuracy tests, do you expect DLR_- to be large or small?
  AnswerChoices: Large; Small; I haven't a clue.
  CorrectAnswer: Small
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Small')
  Hint: What happens when you divide by small number by a larger one?


- Class: text
  Output:  Now to likelihood ratios. Recall Bayes Formula. P(D|+) = P(+|D) * P(D) / ( P(+|D) * P(D) + P(+|~D) * P(~D) ) and notice that if we replace all occurrences of 'D' with '~D', the denominator doesn't change. This means that if we formed a ratio of P(D|+) to P(~D|+) we'd get a much simpler expression (since the complicated denominators would cancel each other out). Like this....

- Class: text
  Output:   P(D|+) / P(~D|+) = P(+|D) * P(D) / P(+|~D) * P(~D) = P(+|D)/P(+|~D) * P(D)/P(~D).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The left side of the equation represents the post-test odds of disease given a positive test result. The equation says that the post-test odds of disease equals the pre-test odds of disease times
  AnswerChoices: the DLR_+; the DLR_-; I haven't a clue.
  CorrectAnswer: the DLR_+
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='the DLR_+')
  Hint: Do you recognize the expression P(+|D) / P(+|~D)? The '+' signs are a big clue.

- Class: text
  Output: In other words, a DLR_+ value equal to N indicates that the hypothesis of disease is N times more supported by the data than the hypothesis of no disease.

- Class: text
  Output:  Taking the formula above and replacing the '+' signs with '-' yields a formula with the DLR_-. Specifically, P(D|-) / P(~D|-) = P(-|D) * P(D) / P(-|~D) * P(~D). This relates the decrease in the odds of the disease post negative test result to the odds of disease pre-test. Remember that we showed that DLR_- is small.

- Class: text
  Output: Two events, A and B, are independent if they have no effect on each other. Formally, P(A&B) = P(A)*P(B). It's easy to see that if A and B are independent, then P(A|B)=P(A). The definition is similar for random variables X and Y.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: We've seen examples of independence in our previous probability lessons. Let's review a little. What's the probability of rolling a '6' twice in a row using a fair dice?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 2/6; 1/36; 1/2
  CorrectAnswer: 1/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/36')
  Hint: Square the probability of rolling a single '6' since the two rolls are independent of one another.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What's the probability of a second roll of the dice matching the first?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 2/6; 1/36; 1/2
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: Now the events aren't independent. You don't care what the first roll is so that's a probability 1 event. The second roll just has to match the first, so that's a 1/6 event.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If the chance of developing a disease is p, is the chance of both you and your sibling developing that disease p*p? 
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: The events aren't independent since genetic or environmental factors likely will affect the outcome.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll conclude with iid. Random variables are said to be iid if they are independent and identically distributed. By independent we mean "statistically unrelated from one another". Identically distributed means that "all have been drawn from the same population distribution".

- Class: text
  Output: Random variables which are iid are the default model for random samples and many of the important theories of statistics assume that variables are iid. We'll usually assume our samples are random and variables are iid.

- Class: text
  Output: Congrats! You've concluded this lesson on conditional probability. We hope you liked it unconditionally.
