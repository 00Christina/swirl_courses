- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we'll continue to discuss probability. 

- Class: text
  Output: Recall that a random variable is a numerical outcome of an experiment. It can be discrete (take on only a countable number of possibilities), or continuous (take on any value on the real line or subset of it).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If you had a ruler of infinite precision, would measuring the height of adults around the world be continuous or discrete?
  AnswerChoices: continuous; discrete
  CorrectAnswer: continuous
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='continuous')
  Hint: The ruler of infinite precision is the hint. Can you list all possible heights?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is the drawing of a hand of cards continuous or discrete?
  AnswerChoices:  discrete; continuous;
  CorrectAnswer: discrete
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='discrete')
  Hint: Can you enumerate the possible outcomes?

- Class: text
  Output: Continuous random variables are usually associated with measurements of time, distance, or some biological process since they can take on any value, often within some specified range. Limitations of precision in taking the measurements may imply that the values are discrete; we in fact consider them continuous. 

- Class: text
  Output: A probability mass function (pmf) gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: For instance, suppose we have a coin which may or may not be fair. Let x=0 represent a 'heads' outcome and x=1 represent a 'tails' outcome of a coin toss. If p is the probability of 'heads' which of the following represents the pmf of the coin toss?  The variable x is either 0 or 1.
  AnswerChoices: (p^x)*(1-p)^(1-x); (p^(1-x))*(1-p)^x
  CorrectAnswer: (p^(1-x))*(1-p)^x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='(p^(1-x))*(1-p)^x')
  Hint: The probability p is associated with a 'heads' outcome which occurs when x=0. Which of the two expressions has an exponent of 1 for p when x is 0?

- Class: text
  Output: A probability density function is associated with a continuous random variable. To quote from Wikipedia, it "is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to take on a given value. The probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values is given by ... the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range." 

- Class: text
  Output: We'll repeat two requirements of a probability density function. It  must be nonnegative everywhere, and the area under it must  equal one."

- Class: figure
  Output: Consider this figure - a rectangle with height 1 and width 2 with a diagonal line drawn from the lower left corner (0,0) to the upper right (2,1). The area of the entire rectangle is 2 and elementary geometry tells us that the diagonal divides the rectangle into 2 equal areas.
  Figure: figure1.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Could the diagonal line represent a probability density function?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: The line segment falls about the x axis. Does the area under the diagonal have area equal to 1?

- Class: figure
  Output: Now consider the shaded portion of the triangle - a smaller triangle with a base of length 1.6 and height determined by the diagonal. We'll answer the question, "What proportion of the big triangle is shaded?"
  Figure: figure2.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: This proportion represents the probability that throwing a piece of cat kibble at the bigger triangle hits the blue portion.

- Class: mult_question
  Output:  We have to compute the area of the blue triangle. We know the base, but what is its height?
  AnswerChoices: .5; .25; .8; I can't tell
  CorrectAnswer: .8
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='.8')
  Hint: The  slope of a line is the "rise" (change in height) divided by the "run" (change in width), so the diagonal's slope is 1/2. At x=1.6, the y value of the diagonal is 1/2 * 1.6. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the area of the blue triangle?
  CorrectAnswer: .64
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(.64)
  Hint: Multiple the base times the height and divide by 2.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So, what is the probability that the kibble we throw at the bigger triangle will hit the blue portion? 
  CorrectAnswer: .64
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(.64)
  Hint: The area of the blue triangle divided by the area of the big triangle gives you the probability.

- Class: text
  Output: This artificial example was to meant to illustrate a simple probability density function (pdf). Most pdf's have underlying formulae more complicated than lines. We'll see more of these in future lessons.  

- Class: text
  Output: The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a random variable X, either discrete or continuous, is the function F(x) equal to the probability that X is less than or equal to x. In the example above, the area of the blue triangle represented the probability that the random variable was less than the value 1.6. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In the triangle example from above, which of the following expressions represents the cdf F(x)? 
  AnswerChoices: x*x/4; x*x/2; x*2x/2; x^2
  CorrectAnswer: x*x/4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x*x/4')
  Hint: The term 'x' is the base, x/2 is the height.  Plug these into the formula for the area of a triangle.

- Class: text
  Output: If you're familiar with calculus you might recognize that when you're computing areas under curves you're integrating functions. When the random variable is continuous the pdf is the derivative of the cdf.  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To see this in the example, we've defined a function, myfun, for you which is the derivative of the cdf F(x). Look at myfun now.
  CorrectAnswer: myfun
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='myfun')
  Hint: Type 'myfun' at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use the R function integrate to integrate myfun with the parameters lower equal to 0 and upper equal to 1.6. See if you get the same area (probability) you got before
  CorrectAnswer: integrate(myfun,0,1.6)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='integrate(myfun,0,1.6)')
  Hint: Type 'integrate(myfun,0,1.6)' at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: The survivor function S(x) of a random variable X is defined as the function of x equal to the probaiblity that X is greater than x. This is the complement of the cdf.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In the triangle example from above, which of the following expressions represents the survival function?  
  AnswerChoices: 1-x*x/4; 1-x*x/2; 1-x*2x/2; 1-x^2
  CorrectAnswer: 1-x*x/4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='1-x*x/4')
  Hint: Since areas under pdf's must be 1 and the survival function is the complement of the cdf, the survival function and the cdf sum to 1.

- Class: text
  Output: The quantile v of a CDF is the point x_v at which the CDF has the value v. More precisely, F(x_v)=v. A percentile is a quantile in which v is expressed as a percentage.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What percentile is the median?  
  AnswerChoices: 50-th; 25-th; 95-th; I can't tell
  CorrectAnswer: 50-th
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='50-th')
  Hint: The median is the point at which half of the outcomes are above and half are below.

- Class: text
  Output: Remember, when we're talking about medians we're referring to population quantities. A probability model connects the data to the population using assumptions. Therefore the  the sample median will be the estimator of the  population median (the estimand).

- Class: exact_question
  Output: When drawing a single card, how many outcomes are possible?
  CorrectAnswer: 52
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=52)
  Hint: How many cards are in the deck?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability of drawing a jack?
  CorrectAnswer: 4/52
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(1/13)
  Hint: How many jacks are in the deck? Divide this number by the number of cards in the deck.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you're dealt a hand of 5 cards, what is the probability of getting all 5 of the same value?
  CorrectAnswer: 0
  AnswerTests: equiv_val(0)
  Hint: There are only 4 different suits in a deck.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the `:`
    operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works.
  CorrectAnswer: '1:20'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='1:20')
  Hint: Type 1:20 with no spaces. Make sure to use a regular colon and NOT a semi-colon.




- Class: mult_question
  Output: The probability of a particular outcome of an experiment is the ratio of the number of ways that outcome can occur to all possible outcomes of the experiment. Since there are 6 possible outcomes to the experiment of rolling a die, and we assume the die is fair, each outcome is equally likely. So what is the probability of rolling a 2?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 2/6; 1/3; 0
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: The '2' is one of six possibilities.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the probability of rolling an even number?
  AnswerChoices: 1/2; 1/3; 0; 1
  CorrectAnswer: 1/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/2')
  Hint: Half of the outcomes are even and half are odd. There are three even outcomes (2,4, and 6) and three odd (1,3, and 5)

- Class: text
  Output: Since the probability of a particular outcome or event E is the ratio of ways that E could occur to the number of all possible outcomes or events, the probability of E, denoted P(E), is always between 0 and 1. Impossible events have a probability of 0 (since they can't occur) and events that are certain to occur have a probability of 1. 

- Class: text
  Output: If you're doing an experiment with n possible outcomes, say e1, e2, ..., en, then the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1. If all the outcomes are equally likely, as in the case of a fair die, then the probability of each is 1/n. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose you rolled the fair die twice. What is the probability of rolling two 4's?
  AnswerChoices: 1/36; 2/6; 0; 1/6
  CorrectAnswer: 1/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/36')
  Hint: The probability of rolling the first 4 is 1/6. The second roll of the dice doesn't depend on the outcome of the first, so that also has a probability of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1/6 * 1/6.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose you rolled the fair die twice. What is the probability of rolling the same number two times in a row?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 2/6; 0; 1/36
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: Since we don't care what the outcome of the first roll is, its probability is 1. The second roll of the dice has to match the outcome of the first, so that  has a probability of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1 * 1/6.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now consider the experiment of rolling 2 dice, one red and one green. Assume the dice are fair and not loaded. How many distinct outcomes are possible?
  AnswerChoices: 36; 12; 11; 1
  CorrectAnswer: 36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='36')
  Hint: Each of the dice has 6 ways to land, and their outcomes are independent of each other. Each way the red die lands can be paired with each way the green die lands. For instance, a "1" on the red dice can occur independently of any of the 6 outcomes of the green dice. 

- Class: text
  Output: If an event E can occur in more than one way and these ways are disjoint (mutually exclusive) then P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of each of the ways in which it can occur. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Rolling these two dice, what's the probability of rolling a 10?
  AnswerChoices: 3/36; 2/36; 1/6; 0
  CorrectAnswer: 3/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3/36')
  Hint: Since the highest possible dice roll is a '6', the only combinations which give '10' are 4+6 and 5+5. The first occurs in two ways - red dice gets '4' and green gets '6' OR red gets '6' and green gets '4'. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the most likely outcome rolling these two dice?
  AnswerChoices: 7; 2; 12; 9; 1
  CorrectAnswer: 7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='7')
  Hint: The choice of '1' is impossible rolling two dice, and '2' and '12' each occur in only one possible way (snake-eyes and double 6's, respectively), so '7' and '9' are the only reasonable choices. To roll '7' you can use any number from '1' to '6', while '9' can only use outcomes of '3' and above.  

- Class: text
  Output: The probability of at least one of two events, A and B, occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability of their intersection. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A&B). 

- Class: text
  Output: It's easy to see why this is. Calculating P(A) and P(B) counts outcomes that are in both A and B twice, so they're overcounted. The probability of the intersection of the two events, denoted as A&B, must be subtracted from the sum.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Back to rolling two dice. Which expression represents the probability of rolling an even number or a number greater than 8?
  AnswerChoices: (18+10-4)/36; (18+10)/36; (18+4-2)/36; (18+10-2)/36
  CorrectAnswer: (18+10-4)/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='(18+10-4)/36')
  Hint: The probability of rolling an even number is 1/2 or 18/36. There are 10 ways of rolling a number greater than '8' - 4 ways for rolling '9', 3 for '10', 2 for '11' and 1 for '12'. How big is the intersection between rolling an even number and those greater than '8'?  

- Class: text
  Output: It follows that if A and B are disjoint or mutually exclusive, i.e. only one of them can occur, then  P(A U B) = P(A)+P(B) .

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following expressions represents the probability of rolling a number greater than 10?
  AnswerChoices: (2+1)/36; (1+1)/36; (3+1)/36; (3+1-1)/36
  CorrectAnswer: (2+1)/36
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='(2+1)/36')
  Hint: The only outcomes greater than 10 are 11 and 12 which are mutually exclusive. The first, 11, can occur in two ways, and the second, 12, can occur only with a roll of double 6's.   

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Use the answer to the previous question and the fact that the sum of all outcomes must sum to 1 to determine the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 10.
  CorrectAnswer: 11/12
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=11/12)
  Hint: Subtract the previous answer from 1.


- Class: text
  Output: Congrats! With probability 1, you've concluded this first lesson on basic probability.
