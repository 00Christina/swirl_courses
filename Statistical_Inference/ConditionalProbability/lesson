- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, as the name suggests, we'll discuss conditional probability. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If you were given a fair dice and asked what the probability of rolling a 3 is, what would you reply?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 1/2; 1/3; 1/4; 1 
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: There are 6 possible outcomes and you want to know the probability of 1 of them.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose the person who gave you the dice rolled it behind your back and told you the roll was odd. Now what is the probability that the roll was a 3?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 1/2; 1/3; 1/4; 1 
  CorrectAnswer: 1/3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/3')
  Hint: Given that there are 3 odd numbers on the dice your possibilities have been reduced to 3 and you want to know the probability of 1 of them.

- Class: text
  Output: The probability of this second event is conditional on this new information, so the probability of rolling a 3 is now one third.

- Class: text
  Output: We represent the conditional probability of an event $A$ given that $B$ has occurred 
with the notation P(A|B). More specifically, we define the conditional probability of event A, given that B has occurred with the following.

- Class: text
  Output:   P(A|B) = P(A & B)/ P(B)

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Back to our dice example. Which of the following expressions represents P(A&B), where A is the event of rolling a 3 and B is the event of the roll being odd?
  AnswerChoices: 1/6; 1/2; 1/3; 1/4; 1 
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: Here A is a subset of B so the probability of both A AND B happening is the probability of A happening. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Continuing with the same dice example. Which of the following expressions represents P(A&B)/P(B), where A is the event of rolling a 3 and B is the event of the roll being odd?
  AnswerChoices: (1/6)/(1/2); (1/2)/(1/6); (1/3)/(1/2); 1/6 
  CorrectAnswer: (1/6)/(1/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='(1/6)/(1/2)')
  Hint: Here A is a subset of B so the probability of both A AND B happening is the probability of A happening. The probability of B is the number of odd numbers between 1 and 6 (includsive).

- Class: text
  Output: From the definition of P(A|B), we can write P(A&B) = P(A|B) * P(B), right?  Let's use this to express P(B|A).

- Class: text
  Output: P(B|A) = P(B&A)/P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B)/P(A). This is a simple form of Bayes' Rule. It relates the two conditional probabilities.

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we don't know P(A) itself, but only know its conditional probabilities, that is, the probability that it occurs if B occurs and the probability that it occurs if B doesn't occur. These are  P(A|B) and P(A|~B), respectively. We use ~B to represent B complement. 

- Class: text
  Output: We can then express P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B) and substitute this is into Bayes' Formula. P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / ( P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B) ) 

- Class: text
  Output: Bayes' Rule has applicability to medical diagnostic tests. We'll now discuss the example of the HIV test from the slides. 

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we know the accuracy rates of the test for both the positive case (positive result when the patient has HIV) and negative (negative test result when the patient doesn't have HIV). BTW, these are referred to as test sensitivity and specificity, respectively.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let 'D' be the event that he has HIV, and let '+' indicate a positive test result and '-' a negative. What information do we know?
  AnswerChoices: P(+|D) and P(-|~D); P(+|~D) and P(-|~D); P(+|~D) and P(-|D); P(+|D) and P(-|D)
  CorrectAnswer: P(+|D) and P(-|~D)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(+|D) and P(-|~D)')
  Hint: The clue here is accuracy. The test is positive when the patient has the disease and negative when he doesn't.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose a person gets a positive test result and comes from a population with a low HIV prevalence (.001). What's the probability that he really has HIV? Which of the following representation what we want to calculate?
  AnswerChoices: P(+|D); P(D|+);P(~D|+); P(D|-)
  CorrectAnswer: P(D|+)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(D|+)')
  Hint: We've already been given the information that the test was positive '+'. We want to know whether D has occurred given the test result.

- Class: text
  Output: We can use Bayes' Formula to express P(D|+), right?

- Class: text
  Output:  P(D|+) = P(+|D) * P(D) / ( P(+|D) * P(D) + P(+|~D) * P(~D) ) . Note that P(~D)=1-P(D) since P(D)+P(~D)=1. Also, P(+|~D)=1-P(-|~D). With these substitutions we can calculate P(D|+). We said before we know P(+|D) and P(-|~D). We can use the prevalence of HIV in the patient's population as the value for P(D).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The diagnostic likelihood ratio of a positive test, DLR_+, is the ratio of two conditional probabilities. Specifically, DLR_+=P(+|D) / P(+|~D). Similarly, the DLR_- is a ratio. Which of the following do you think represents the DLR_-?
  AnswerChoices: P(-|D) / P(-|~D); P(+|~D) / P(-|D);P(-|D) / P(+|~D); I haven't a clue.
  CorrectAnswer: P(-|D) / P(-|~D)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(-|D) / P(-|~D)')
  Hint: The signs of the test in both the numerator and denominator have to agree as they did for the DLR_+.

- Class: text
  Output:  Recall this formula P(D|+) = P(+|D) * P(D) / ( P(+|D) * P(D) + P(+|~D) * P(~D) ) and notice that if we replace all occurrences of 'D' with '~D', the denominator wouldn't change. This means that if we formed a ratio of P(D|+) to P(~D|+) we'd get a much simpler expression (since the denominators would cancel each other out).

- Class: text
  Output:  Specifically, P(D|+) / P(~D|+) = P(+|D) * P(D) / P(+|~D) * P(~D).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: This says that the post-test odds of disease equals the pre-test odds of disease times
  AnswerChoices: the DLR_+; the DLR_-; I haven't a clue.
  CorrectAnswer: the DLR_+
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='the DLR_+')
  Hint: In the formula above, the right hand side can be expressed as P(+|D) / P(+|~D) * P(D) / P(~D). The '+' signs are a big clue.

- Class: text
  Output:  In other words, a DLR_+ value equal to N indicates that the hypothesis of disease is N times more supported by the data than the hypothesis of no disease.

- Class: text
  Output:  Taking the formula above and replacing the '+' signs with '-' yields a formula with the DLR_-. Specifically, P(D|-) / P(~D|-) = P(-|D) * P(D) / P(-|~D) * P(~D). This relates the decrease in the odds of the disease post negative test result to the odds of disease pre-test.

- Class: text
  Output: Two events, A and B, are independent if they have no effect on each other. Formally, P(A&B) = P(A)*P(B). It's easy to see that if A and B are independent, then P(A|B)=P(A). The definition is similar for random variables X and Y.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: We've seen examples of independence in our previous probability lessons. Let's review a little. What's the probability of rolling a '6' twice in a row using a fair dice?
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6; 2/6; 1/36; 1/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/36')
  Hint: Square the probability of rolling a single '6' since the two rolls are independent of one another.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What's the probability of a second roll of the dice matching the first?
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6; 2/6; 1/36; 1/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1/6')
  Hint: Now the events aren't independent. You don't care what the first roll is so that's a probability 1 event. The second roll just has to match the first, so that's a 1/6 event.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If the chance of developing a disease is p, is the chance of both you and your sibling developing the same disease p*p? 
  CorrectAnswer: Yes; No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: The events aren't independent since genetic or environmental factors likely will affect the outcome.

- Class: text
  Output: We'll conclude with iid. Random variables are said to be iid if they are independent and identically distributed. By indedpendent we mean "statistically unrelated from one another". Identically distributed means that "all have been drawn from the same population distribution".

- Class: text
  Output: Random variables which are iid are the default model for random samples and many of the important theories of statistics assume that variables are iid. We'll usually assume our samples are random and variables are iid.

- Class: text
  Output: Congrats! You've concluded this lesson on conditional probability. We hope you liked it unconditionally.
