  Output: In this lesson, we'll discuss variances of distributions which, like means, are useful in characterizing them. While the mean characterizes the center of a distribution, the variance and standard deviation characterize the distribution's spread around the mean. A sample variance estimates the population variance.

- Class: text
  Output: The variance of a random variable, as a measure of spread or dispersion,  is defined as the expected (squared) distance of the variable from the mean. Squaring the distance makes it positive so values lesser and greater than the mean are treated the same. In mathematical terms,

- Class: text
  Output: Var(x) = E((X-E(X))^2) = E(X^2) - E(2XE(X)) + (E(X)^2) = E(X^2)-E(X)^2 

- Class: text
  Output: Higher variance implies more spread around a mean than lower variance. 

- Class: text
  Output: Finally, it's easy to show from the definition and the linearity of expectations that Var(aX)=a^2*Var(X). This will come in handy later.  Here's the proof.

- Class: text
  Output: Var(aX) = E(a^2*X^2)-E(aX)^2 = a^2E(X^2)-(aE(X))^2 = a^2E(X^2)-a^2*E(X)^2 = a^2*Var(X)

  Output: We've defined a 6-long vector for you, dice_sqr, which holds the squares of the integers 1 through 6. Look at it now.
  CorrectAnswer: dice_sqr
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dice_sqr')
  Hint: Type dice_sqr at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using R's ability to multiply vectors componentwise and its function 'sum' you can easily compute E(X^2) for any of the three defined dice. Simply sum the product dice_sqr * PDF. Recall that we defined three PDF's, (dice_fair, dice_high, and dice_low). Try this now with dice_fair and put the result in a variable ex2_fair.
  CorrectAnswer: ex2_fair <- sum(dice_fair * dice_sqr)
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('ex2_fair <- sum(dice_fair * dice_sqr)','ex2_fair <- sum(dice_sqr * dice_fair)')
  Hint: Type 'ex2_fair <- sum(dice_fair * dice_sqr)' at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Recall that the expected value of a fair dice roll is 3.5. Subtract the square of that from ex2_fair to compute the sample variance.
  CorrectAnswer: ex2_fair-3.5^2
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('ex2_fair-3.5^2','ex2_fair-3.5*3.5')
  Hint: Type 'ex2_fair-3.5^2' at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use a similar approach to compute the sample variance of dice_high. Recall that edh holds the expected value of dice_high.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(dice_high * dice_sqr)-edh^2
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('sum(dice_high * dice_sqr)-edh^2','sum(dice_sqr * dice_high)-edh^2','sum(dice_high * dice_sqr)-edh*edh','sum(dice_sqr * dice_high)-edh*edh')
  Hint: Type 'sum(dice_high * dice_sqr)-edh^2' at the command prompt.

  Output: Notice that when we talk about variance we're using square units. Because it is often more useful to use measurements in the same units as X we define the standard deviation of X as the square root of Var(X). 

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's a figure from the slides. It shows several normal distributions all centered around a common mean 0, but with different standard deviations. The thinner the bell the smaller the standard deviation.

- Class: text
  Output: Just as we distinguished between a population mean and a sample mean we have to distinguish between a population variance Var(X) and a sample variance S^2. This latter is defined as the sum of n squared distances from the sample mean divided by (n-1), where n is the number of samples. In other words, the sample variance is almost the average squared deviation from the sample mean.

- Class: text
  Output: The sample variance is also a random variable with an associated population distribution. Its expected value is the population variance and its distribution gets more concentrated around the population variance with more data.
The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance.

- Class: figure
  Output: To illustrate this point, consider this figure which plots the distribution of 10000 variances, each of 10 standard normal random samples. The vertical line indicates the standard deviation 1.
  Figure: moredata1.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: Here we do the same experiment but this time each of the 10000 variances is over 20 standard normal samples. We've plotted over the first plot and you can see that the distribution of the variances is getting tighter.
  Figure: moredata2.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: Finally, we repeat the experiment using 30 samples for each of the 10000 variances. You can see that with more data, the distribution gets more concentrated around the population variance it is trying to estimate.

- Class: text
  Output: Recall that unbiased estimators equal the value they're trying to estimate. We can see from the above that the sample variance is an unbiased estimator of population variance. Dividing by (n-1) makes the sample variance an unbiased estimator.

- Class: text
  Output: Recall that the average of random samples from a population is itself a random variable with a distribution centered around the population mean. Specifically, E(X') = mu, where X' represents a sample mean and mu is the population mean.

- Class: text
  Output:  We also know that the variance of the sample means is the squared population variance divided by the sample size. Specifically,  Var(X') = sigma^2 / n. This allows us to relate the population variance to the variance of the sample mean.

- Class: text
  Output: The standard deviation of a statistic is called its standard error, so the standard error of the sample mean is s/sqrt(n). 

- Class: text
  Output: The sample variance, s^2, estimates the population variance, sigma^2, so   the distribution of the sample variance is centered around sigma^2. 

- Class: text
  Output: The variance of sample mean is sigma^2 / n and we estimate it with s^2 / n. It follows that the  logical estimate of the standard error is s / sqrt(n).

- Class: text
  Output: s, the standard deviation, talks about how variable the population is, and s/sqrt(n), the standard error, talks about how variable the averages of random samples of size n from the population are.







- Class: text
  Output: Chebyshev's inequality helps interpret variances. This inequality states that the probability that a random variable X is at least k standard deviations from its mean is less than 1/(k^2). In other words, the probability that X is at least 2 standard deviations from the mean is less than 1/4, 3 standard deviations 1/9, 4 standard deviations 1/16, etc.

- Class: text
  Output: However this estimate is quite conservative for random variables that are normally distributed, that is, with bell-curve distributions. In these cases, the probability of being at least 2 standard deviations from the mean is about 5% (as compared to Chebyshev's 25%) and the probability of being at least 3 standard deviations from the mean is roughly .2%.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose you had a measurement that was 4 standard deviations from the the distribution's mean. What would be the upper bound  of the probability of this happening using Chebyshev's inequality? 
  AnswerChoices: 6%; 0%; 11%; 25%; 96% 
  CorrectAnswer: 6%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='6%')
  Hint: Chebyshev's inequality estimates that probability as 1/16. Convert this to a probability.

- Class: text
  Output: Congrats! You've concluded this lesson on expectations. We hope it met yours.
