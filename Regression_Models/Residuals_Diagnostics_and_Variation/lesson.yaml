- Class: figure
  Output: "In the accompanying figure there is a fairly obvious outlier. However obvious, it does not affect the fit very much as can be seen by comparing the orange line with the black. The orange line represents a fit in which the outlier is included in the data set, and the black line represents a fit in which the outlier is excluded. Including this outlier does not change the fit very much, so it is said to lack influence."

- Class: figure
  Output: "This next figure also has a fairly obvious outlier, but in this case including the outlier changes the fit a great deal. The slope and the residuals of the orange line are very different than those of the black line. This outlier is said to be influential."

  Output: "Outliers may or may not belong in the data. They may represent real events or they may be spurious. In any case, they should be examined. In order to spot them, R provides various diagnostic plots and measures of influence. In this lesson we'll illustrate their meanings and use. The basic technique is to examine the effects of leaving one sample out, as we did in comparing the black and orange lines above. We'll use the influential outlier to illustrate, since leaving it out has clear effects."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The influential outlier is in a data frame named out2. It has two columns, labeled y and x, respectively. To begin, create a model named fit using fit <- lm(y ~ x, out2) or an equivalent expression."
  CorrectAnswer: fit <- lm(y ~ x, out2)
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model('fit <- lm(y ~ x, out2)')
  Hint: "Enter fit <- lm(y ~ x, out2) or something equivalent at the R prompt."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The simplest diagnostic plot displays residuals versus fitted values. Residuals should be uncorrelated with the fit, and should be independently and identically disributed with mean zero. Enter plot(fit, which=1) at the R prompt to see if this is the case."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(fit, which=1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(fit, which=1)')
  Hint: Enter plot(fit, which=1) at the R prompt
  Figure: restore_1.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "Do the residuals appear uncorrelated with the fit?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No. There is a linear pattern involving all but one residual and the fit.
  CorrectAnswer: No. There is a linear pattern involving all but one residual and the fit.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'No. There is a linear pattern involving all but one residual and the fit.')
  Hint: "There is an obvious linear relation between fit and most residuals."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "The Residuals vs Fitted plot labels certain points with their row names or numbers, numbers in our case. Which of the three labeled points would you guess is our influential outlier?"
  AnswerChoices: 1;13;50
  CorrectAnswer: 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '1')
  Hint: "It's pretty distinctive. For instance, it's far away from the others."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Our influential outlier is in row 1 of the data. To exclude it is just a matter using out2[-1, ] rather than out2 as data. Create a second model, named fitno for 'fit with no outlier', which excludes the outlier."
  CorrectAnswer: fitno <- lm(y ~ x, out2[-1, ])
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model('fitno <- lm(y ~ x, out2[-1,])')
  Hint: "Enter fitno <- lm(y ~ x, out2[-1, ]) or something equivalent at the R prompt."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Display a Residuals vs Fitted plot for fitno. Remember to use which=1."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(fitno, which=1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('plot(fitno, which=1)')
  Hint: Type plot(fitno, which=1) at the R prompt
  Figure: restore_2.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: "This plot has none of the patterned appearance of the first. It looks as we would expect if residuals were independently and identically distributed with zero mean, and were uncorrelated with the fit."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The change which inclusion or exclusion of a sample induces in coefficents is a simple measure of its influence. Subtract coef(fitno) from coef(fit) to see the change induced by including the influential first sample."
  CorrectAnswer: coef(fit)-coef(fitno)
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('coef(fit)-coef(fitno)', 'fit$coef-fitno$coef', 'fit$coefficients-fitno$coefficients')
  Hint: "Just enter coef(fit)-coef(fitno) at the R prompt."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "dfbeta: R's command, dfbeta, does the equivalent calculation for every sample in the data. The first row of dfbeta(fit) should match the difference we've just calculated. The second row is a similar calculation for the second sample, and so on. Since dfbeta returns a large matrix, use either head(dfbeta(fit)) or View(dfbeta(fit)) to examine the result."
  CorrectAnswer: head(dfbeta(fit))
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('head(dfbeta(fit))', 'View(dfbeta(fit))')
  Hint: Enter either head(dfbeta(fit)) or View(dfbeta(fit)) at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: "Comparing the first row with those below it, we see that the first sample has a much larger effect on the slope (the x column) than other samples. In fact, the magnitude of its effect is about 100 times that of any other point. Its effect on the intercept is not very distinctive essentially because its y coordinate is 0, the mean of the other samples."

- Class: figure
  Output: "When a sample is included in a model, it pulls the regression line closer to itself (orange line) than that of the model which excludes it (black line.) Its residual, the difference between its actual y value and that of a regression line, is thus smaller in magnitude when it is included (orange dots) than when it is omitted (black dots.) The ratio of these two residuals, orange to black, is therefore small in magnitude for an influential sample. For a sample which is not influential the ratio would be close to 1. Hence, 1 minus the ratio is a measure of influence, near 0 for points which are not influential, and near 1 for points which are."
  Figure: hatvalues.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "This measure is sometimes called influence, sometimes leverage, and sometimes hatvalue. Since it is 1 minus the ratio of two residuals, to calculate it from scratch we must first obtain the two residuals. The ratio's numerator (orange dots) is the residual of the first sample of the model we called fit. The model fitno, which excludes this sample, also excludes its residual, so we will have to calculate its value. This is easily done. We use R's predict function to calculate fitno's predicted value of y and subtract it from the actual value. Use the expression resno <- out2[1, \"y\"] - predict(fitno, out2[1,]) to do the calculation."
  CorrectAnswer: resno <- out2[1, "y"] - predict(fitno, out2[1,])
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('resno <- out2[1, "y"] - predict(fitno, out2[1,])', "resno <- out2[1, 'y'] - predict(fitno, out2[1,])")
  Hint: Enter the expression resno <- out2[1, "y"] - predict(fitno, out2[1,]) at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now calculate the influence of our outlier using 1-resid(fit)[1]/resno or an equivalent expression."
  CorrectAnswer: 1-resid(fit)[1]/resno
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='EXPR', correctVal=VAL)
  Hint: hint
