# Explain objectives.

# An outlier is influential if its inclusion substantially changes the model. Illustrate with figures.

# Elementary diagnostic plot: residuals against fitted values

# Two less elementary techniques: leave one out and mean shift.

# Mean shift first since it only leads to student?

# leave one out:
# dffits, dfbetas, PRESS residuals (leave on out and predict), hatvalues.
# Cook's distance, provided leverage means hat values or something derived from hat values.
