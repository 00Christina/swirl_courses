- Class: text
  Output: This is the third and final lesson in which we'll look at regression models with more than one independent variable. We'll begin with  WHO hunger data which we've taken the liberty to load for you. WHO is the World Health Organization and this is data concerning young children from around the world and rates of hunger among these children which the organization compiled over a number of years. The original csv file was very large and we've subsetted just the rows which identify the gender of the child as either male or female. We've read the data into the data frame "hunger" for you, so you can easily access it.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As we did in the last lesson let's first try to get a better understanding of the dataset. Use the R function dim to find the dimensions of hunger.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(hunger)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(hunger)')
  Hint: Type "dim(hunger)" at the R prompt.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many samples does hunger have?
  CorrectAnswer: 948
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=948)
  Hint: The R function dim returns two numbers, the number of rows and the number of columns. Each row represents one sample.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use the R function names to find out what the 13 columns of hunger represent.
  CorrectAnswer: names(hunger)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(hunger)')
  Hint: Type "names(hunger)" at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: The Numeric column tells us the percentage of children under age 5 who are underweight. This is one of the columns we'll be focussing on in this lesson.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's first look at the rate of hunger and see how it's changed over time. Use the R function lm to generate the linear model in which the rate of hunger, Numeric, depends on the predictor, Year. Put the result in the variable lm1. 
  CorrectAnswer: lm1 <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year)
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model <- function('lm1 <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year)')
  Hint: Remember you need to pass a formula, dependent ~ independent, to the model. Also, you may need to specify the data set if it isn't clear from the variables you enter in the formula. So type "lm1 <- lm(Numeric ~ Year, hunger)" at the R prompt or more simply lm1 <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now look at the coef portion of the summary of lm1.  
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lm1)$coef
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(lm1)$coef')
  Hint: Type "summary(lm1)$coef" at the R prompt.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the coefficient of hunger$Year?
  AnswerChoices: -0.30840; 0.06053; 634.47966;  121.14460
  CorrectAnswer: -0.30840
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='-0.30840')
  Hint: Look at the hunger$Year row and Estimate column of the summary output.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the negative Estimate of hunger$Year show?
  AnswerChoices: As time goes on, the rate of hunger decreases; As time goes on, the rate of hunger increases; I haven't a clue
  CorrectAnswer: As time goes on, the rate of hunger decreases
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='As time goes on, the rate of hunger decreases')
  Hint: Recall the meaning of the slope of a line: for every unit change in the independent variable (Year) there is a -.3084 change (decrease) in the dependent variable (percentage of hungry children).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's use R's subsetting capability to look at the rates of hunger for the different genders to see how, or even if, they differ.  Once again use the R function lm to generate the linear model in which the rate of hunger (Numeric) for female children depends on Year. Put the result in the variable lmF. You'll have to use the R construct x[hunger$Sex=="Female"] to pick out both the correct Numerics and the correct Years.
  CorrectAnswer: lmF <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Female"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex=="Female"])
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model <- function('lmF <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Female"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex==\"Female\"])')
  Hint: Type lmF <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Female"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex=="Female"]) at the R prompt or more simply lmF <- lm(Numeric[Sex=="Female"] ~ Year[Sex=="Female"],hunger)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Do the same for male children and put the result in lmM.
  CorrectAnswer: lmM <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Male"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex=="Male"])
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model <- function('lmM <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Male"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex=="Male"])')
  Hint: Type lmM <- lm(hunger$Numeric[hunger$Sex=="Male"] ~ hunger$Year[hunger$Sex=="Male"]) at the R prompt or more simply lmM <- lm(Numeric[Sex=="Male"] ~ Year[Sex=="Male"],hunger)

- Class: figure
  Output: Now we'll plot the data points and fitted lines using different colors to distinguish between males (blue) and females (pink).
  Figure: plot1.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: We can see from the plot that the lines are not exactly parallel. On the right side of the graph (around the year 2010) they are closer together than on the left side (around 1970). Since they aren't parallel, their slopes must be different, though both are negative. Of the following R expressions which would confirm that the slope for males is negative?
  AnswerChoices: lmM$coef[2]; lmF$coef[2]; lmM$coef[1] 
  CorrectAnswer:  lmM$coef[2]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='lmM$coef')
  Hint: First, eliminate the female choice, then recall that the first coefficient is the intercept of the line and the second is the slope. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now instead of separating the data by subsetting the samples by gender we'll use gender as another predictor when we create the linear model lmBoth. Recall that to do this in R we place a plus sign "+" between the independent variables, so the formula looks like dependent ~ independent1 + independent2. Create  lmBoth now. Numeric is the dependent. Year and Sex are the independent. The data is "hunger".
  CorrectAnswer: lmBoth <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year + hunger$Sex)
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model <- function('lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year + hunger$Sex)')
  Hint: Type lmBoth <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year + hunger$Sex) or more simply lmBoth <- lm(Numeric ~ Year+Sex,hunger)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now look at the summary of lmBoth with the R command summary.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lmBoth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExprl='summary(lmBoth')
  Hint: Type summary(lmBoth) at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: Notice that three estimates are given, the intercept, one for Year and one for Male. What happened to the estimate for Female? Note that Male and Female are categorical variables hence they are factors in this model. Recall from the last lesson (and slides) that R treats the first (alphabetical) factor as the reference and its estimate is the intercept which represents the percentage of hungry females at year 0. The estimate given for the factor Male is a distance from the intercept (the estimate of the reference group Female). To calculate the percentage of hungry males at year 0 you have to add together the intercept and the male estimate given by the model.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What percentage of young Males were hungry at year 0?
  AnswerChoices: 635.431; 1.9027; 633.2199; I can't tell since the data starts at 1970. 
  CorrectAnswer: 635.431 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='635.431')
  Hint: The intercept is the percentage of females hungry at year 0 and the intercept plus hunger$SexMale is the percentage of males hungry at year 0.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the estimate for hunger$Year represent?
  AnswerChoices: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry children of both genders; the annual decrease in percentage of hungry females;  the annual decrease in percentage of hungry males;
  CorrectAnswer: the annual decrease in percentage of hungry children of both genders;
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='the annual decrease in percentage of hungry children of both genders;')
  Hint: The model looked at all the data and didn't specify which gender to consider.

- Class: figure
  Output: Now we'll replot the data points along with two new lines using different colors. The lines will the same slope (so they'll be parallel). The red line will have the female intercept and the  blue line will have the male intercept. 
  Figure: parallelplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: Now we'll consider the interaction between time and gender to see how that affects changes in rates of hunger. To do this we'll add a third term to the predictor portion of our model formula, the product of year and gender.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create the model lmInter. Numeric is the outcome and the three predictors are Year, Sex, and Sex*Year. The data is "hunger".
  CorrectAnswer: lmInter <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year + hunger$Sex + hunger$Year * hunger$Sex)
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model <- function('lmInter <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year + hunger$Sex + hunger$Year * hunger$Sex)')
  Hint: Type lmInter <- lm(hunger$Numeric ~ hunger$Year + hunger$Sex + hunger$Year * hunger$Sex) or lmInter <- lm(Numeric ~ Year + Sex + Year*Sex, hunger)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now look at the summary of lmInter with the R command summary.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lmInter)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(lmInter)')
  Hint: Type summary(lmInter) at the R prompt.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the percentage of hungry females at year 0?
  AnswerChoices: 603.5058; 61.94772; The model doesn't say.
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctVal='603.5058')
  Hint: As before, the intercept is the percentage of hunger for the first factor, in this case, females. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the percentage of hungry males at year 0?
  AnswerChoices: 665.4535; 603.5058; 61.94772; The model doesn't say.
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctVal='665.4535')
  Hint: As before, the estimate associated with SexMale is the distance from the intercept, so the intercept of the line associated with males is the intercept plus the estimate associated with males.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the annual change in percentage of hungry females?
  AnswerChoices: -0.29340; -0.03000; 0.08547; The model doesn't say.
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctVal='-0.29340')
  Hint: The estimaate associated with Year represents the annual change in percent of hungry females.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the annual change in percentage of hungry males?
  AnswerChoices: -0.32340; -0.03000; 0.12087; The model doesn't say.
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctVal='-0.32340')
  Hint: The estimate associated with Year:SexMale represents the distance of the annual change in percent of males from that of females.

- Class: figure
  Output: Now we'll replot the data points along with two new lines using different colors to distinguish between the genders. 
  Figure: interactplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which line has the steeper slope?
  AnswerChoices: Male; Female; They look about the same
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctVal='Male')
  Hint: The lines are not parallel and will eventually intersect. The line that is further from horizontal (which has slope 0) has a steeper slope and indicates a faster rate of change. Which line has a slope further from 0?

- Class: text
  Output: Finally, we note that things are a little trickier when we're dealing with an interaction between predictors which are continuous (and not factors). The slides show the underlying algebra, but we can summarize. 

- Class: text
  Output: When one of the (interacting) predictors is held constant, the expected change in the outcome is a function of that predictor. More precisely, the expected change in the outcome is the estimate (coefficient) of the changing predictor + the estimate of the interaction * the value of the predictor held constant.

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose the linear model is Hi = b0 + (b1*Ii) + (b2*Yi)+ (b3*Ii×Yi) + ei. Here the H's represent the outcomes, the I's and Y's the predictors, neither of which is a category, and the b's represent the estimates (or coefficients). We can ignore the e's which represent the errors of the model. This models a continuous interaction since neither I nor Y is a factor. Suppose we fix I at some value and let Y vary.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which expression represents the change in H per unit change in Y given that I is fixed at 5?
  AnswerChoices: b2+b3*5; b1+5*b3; b0+b2; b1+b3
  CorrectAnswer: omnitest(correctVal='b2+b3*5')
  Hint: The expected change in the outcome is the estimate of the changing predictor (Y) + the estimate of the interaction  (b3) * the value of the predictor held constant (5).

- Class: text
  Output: Congratulations! You've finished this final lesson in multivariable regression models.
