# Notes for VIF

## Preamble:
### BC: "In modeling, our interest lies in parsimonious, interpretable representations of the data that enhance our understanding of the phenomena under study."
### BC: "Omitting variables results in bias in the coefficients of interest - unless their regressors are uncorrelated with the omitted ones."
### BC: "[I]ncluding any new variables increases (actual, not estimated) standard errors of other regressors. So we don't want to idly throw variables into the model."
### This lesson is about the second of these two phenomena which is called Variance Inflation.

# He also does nested model testing with anova, but I think that and the following might best be done in another swirl lesson. This one is primarily VIF.

# Omitting variables results in bias in the coeficients of interest - unless their regressors are uncorrelated with the omitted ones. Randomized treatments.

# The model must tend toward perfect fit as the number of non-redundant regressors approaches n.

# Example: R2 increases monotonically as more regressors are included.

# Example: The SSE decreases monotonically as more regressors are included.
