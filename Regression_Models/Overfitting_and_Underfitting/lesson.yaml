  Output:"The Variance Inflation Factors lesson demonstrated that including new variables will increase standard errors of coefficient estimates of other, correlated regressors. Hence, we don't want to idly throw variables into the model. On the other hand, omitting variables results in bias in coefficients of regressors which are correlated with the omitted ones. In this lesson we demonstrate the effect of omitted variables and discuss the use of ANOVA to construct parsimonious, interpretable representations of the data."

  Output: "First, I would like to illustrate how omitting a correlated regressor can bias estimates of a coefficient. The relevant source code is in a file named fitting.R which I have copied into your working directory and tried to display in your source code editor. If I've failed to display it, you should open it manually."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "Find the function simbias() at the top of fitting.R. Below the comment labeled Point A three regressors, x1, x2, and x3, are defined. Which of these two are correlated?"
  AnswerChoices: "x1 and x2;x1 and x3;x2 and x3"
  CorrectAnswer: "x1 and x2"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'x1 and x2')
  Hint: The variable, temp, is involved in forming both x1 and x2.

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "Within simbias() another function, f(n), is defined. It forms a dependent variable, y, and at Point C returns the coefficient of x1 as estimated by two models, y ~ x1 + x2, and y ~ x1 + x3. One regressor is missing in each model. In the expression for y (Point B,) what is the actual coefficient of x1?"
  AnswerChoices: 1;0.3;1/sqrt(2)
  CorrectAnswer: 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '1')
  Hint: "What is the coefficient of x1 in the sum, x1 + x2 + x3?"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "At Point D in symbias() the internal function, f(), is applied 150 times and the results returned as a 2x150 matrix. The first row of this matrix contains independent estimates of x1's coefficient in the case that x3, the regressor uncorrelated with x1, is omitted. The second row contains estimates of x1's coefficient when the correlated regressor, x2, is omitted. Use simbias(), accepting the default argument, to form these estimates and store the result in a variable called x1c. (The default argument just guarantees a nice histogram, in a figure to follow.)"
  CorrectAnswer: "x1c <- simbias()"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x1c <- simbias()')
  Hint: Just enter x1c <- simbias() at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The actual coefficient of x1 is 1. Having been warned that omitting a correlated regressor would bias estimates of x1's coefficient, we would expect the mean estimate of x1c's second row to be farther from 1 than the mean of x1c's second row. Using apply(x1c, 1, mean), find the means of each row."
  CorrectAnswer: apply(x1c, 1, mean)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='apply(x1c, 1, mean)')
  Hint: Enter apply(x1c, 1, mean) at the R prompt.

- Class: figure
  Output: "Histograms of estimates from x1c's first row (blue) and second row (red) are shown. Estimates from the second row are clearly more than two standard deviations from the correct value of 1, and the bias due to omitting the correlated regressor is evident. (The code which produced this figure is incidental to the lesson, but is available as the function x1hist(), at the bottom of fitting.R."

- Class: figure
  Output: "Adding even irrelevant regressors can cause a model to tend toward a perfect fit. We illustrate this by adding random regressors to the swiss data and regressing on progressively more of them. As the number of regressors approaches the number of data points (47), the residual sum of squares, also known as the deviance, approaches 0. (The source code for this figure can be found as function bogus() in fitting.R."
