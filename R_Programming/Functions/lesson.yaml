  Output: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of the R language. They are small 
    pieces of reusable code that can be treated like any other R object.

- Class: text
  Output: Functions usually take arguments which are variables that the function operates on. For example,
    the mean() function takes a vector as as argument, like in the case of mean(c(2,6,8)) . The mean()
    function then adds up all of the numbers in the vector and divides that sum by the
    length of the vector.

- Class: script
  Output: The last R expression to be evaluated in a function is the return value of that function.
    We want this function to take one argument, x, and return x without modifying it. Delete the pound
    sign so that x is returned without any modification.
  AnswerTests: test_func1()
  Hint: Make sure to delete the pound sign so the last expression in the function is just x.
  Script: boring_function.R
