  Version: 2.2.14

- Class: text
  Output: Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of the R language. They are small 
    pieces of reusable code that can be treated like any other R object.

- Class: text
  Output: "If you've worked through any other part of this course, you've probably
    used some functions already. Functions are usually characterized by the name
    of the function followed by parentheses."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's try using a few basic functions just for fun. The Sys.Date()
    function returns a string representing today's date. Type Sys.Date() below 
      and see what happens."
  CorrectAnswer: Sys.Date()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sys.Date()')
  Hint: "Display today's date by typing: Sys.Date()"

- Class: text
  Output: "Most functions in R return a value. Functions like Sys.Date() return a
    value based on your computer's environment, while other functions manipulate 
    input data in order to compute a return value."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The mean() function takes a vector of numbers as input, and returns
    the average of all of the numbers in the input vector. Inputs to functions
    are often called arguments. Providing arguments to a function is also
    sometimes called passing arguments to that function. Arguments you want to 
    pass to a function go inside the function's parentheses. Try passing the argument
    c(2, 4, 5) to the mean() function."
  CorrectAnswer: mean(c(2, 4, 5))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(c(2, 4, 5))')
  Hint: "Compute the average of 2, 4, and 5 by typing: mean(c(2, 4, 5))"

- Class: text
  Output: Functions usually take arguments which are variables that the function operates on. For example,
    the mean() function takes a vector as as argument, like in the case of mean(c(2,6,8)). The mean()
    function then adds up all of the numbers in the vector and divides that sum by the
    length of the vector.

- Class: text
  Output: In the following question you will be asked to modify a script that will
    appear as soon as you move on from this question. When you have finished modifying
    the script, save your changes to the script and type submit() and the script
    will be evaluated. There will be some comments in the script that opens up, so be
    sure to read them!

- Class: script
  Output: The last R expression to be evaluated in a function will become the 
    return value of that function. We want this function to take one argument, 
    x, and return x without modifying it. Delete the pound
    sign so that x is returned without any modification. Make sure to save your
    script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: test_func1()
  Hint: Make sure to delete the pound sign so the last expression in the function is just x.
  Script: boring_function.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now that you've created your first function let's test it! Type: 
    boring_function('My first function!'). If your function works, it should
    just return the string: 'My first function!'"
  CorrectAnswer: "boring_function('My first function!')"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="boring_function('My first function!')")
  Hint: "Test boring_function by typing: boring_function('My first function!')"

- Class: text
  Output: "Congratulations on writing your first function. By writing functions,
    you can gain serious insight into how R works. As John Chambers, the creator
    of R once said:\n\n To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
    1. Everything that exists is an object. 2. Everything that happens is a function call."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "If you want to see the source code for any function, just type the
    function name without any arguments or parentheses. Let's try this out with
    the function you just created. Type: boring_function to view its source code."
  CorrectAnswer: boring_function
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boring_function')
  Hint: "To see the source code for boring_function just type: boring_function"

- Class: text
  Output: "Time to make a more useful function! We're going to replicate the
    functionality of the mean() function by creating a function called: my_mean().
    Remember that to calculate the average of all of the numbers in a vector you
    find the sum of all the numbers in the vector, and then divide that sum by the
    number of numbers in the vector." 

- Class: script
  Output: Make sure to save your script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: test_func2()
  Hint: "Use the sum() function to find the sum of all the numbers in the vector. Use
    the length() function to find the size of the vector."
  Script: my_mean.R

- Class: text
  Output: "Next, let's try writing a function with default argumets. You can set
    default values for a function's argumets, and this can be useful if you think
    someone who uses your funciton will set a certain argument to the same value
    most of the time."

- Class: script
  Output: Make sure to save your script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: test_func3()
  Hint: "Remember to set the appropriate default values!"
  Script: remainder.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's do some testing of the remainder function. Run remainder(5)
    and see what happens."
  CorrectAnswer: remainder(5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='remainder(5)')
  Hint: "Let's test your remainder function by running: remainder(5)"

- Class: text
  Output: "Let's take a moment to examine what just happened. You provided one
    argument to the function, and R matched that argument to 'num' since 'num'
    is the first argument. The default value for 'divisor' is 2, so the function
    used the default value you provided."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now let's test the remainder function by providing two arguments.
    Type: remainder(11, 5) and let's see what happens."
  CorrectAnswer: remainder(11, 5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='remainder(11, 5)')
  Hint: "Let's test your remainder function by running: remainder(11, 5)"

- Class: text
  Output: "Once again, the arguments have been matched appropriately."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "You can also explicitly specify arguments in a function. When you
    explicitly designate argument values by name, the ordering of the arguments
    becomes unimportant. You can try this out by typing: 
    remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)."
  CorrectAnswer: remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)')
  Hint: "Order no longer matters when you explicity state argument values! Test
  this out by typing: remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)"

- Class: text
  Output: "As you can see, there is a significant difference between
    remainder(11, 5) and remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)!"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "R can also partially match arguments. Try typing remainder(4, div = 2)
    to see this feature in action."
  CorrectAnswer: remainder(4, div = 2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='remainder(4, div = 2)')
  Hint: "Test out partial matching by typing: remainder(4, div = 2)"

- Class: text
  Output: "A word of warning: in general you want to make your code as easy to
    understand as possible. Switching around the orders of arguments by
    specifying their names or only using partial argument names can be
    confusing, so use these features with caution!"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "With all of this talk about arguments, you may be wondering if there
    is a way you can see a function's arguments (besides looking at the 
    documentation). Thankfully, you can use the args() function! Type:
    args(remainder) to examine the arguments for the remainder function."
  CorrectAnswer: args(remainder)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='args(remainder)')
  Hint: "Look at the arguments of the remainder function by typing: 
    args(remainder)"

- Class: text
  Output: "You may not realize it but I just tricked you into doing something
    pretty interesting! args() is a function, remainder() is a function, yet
    remainder was an argument for args(). Yes it's true: you can pass functions
    as arguments! This is a very powerful concept. Let's write a script to see
    how it works."

- Class: script
  Output: Make sure to save your script before you type submit().
  AnswerTests: test_func4()
  Hint: "Make sure that when you pass a function as an argument you pass the
    name of the function without parentheses!"
  Script: evaluate.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's take your new evaluate() function for a spin! Use evaluate to 
    find the standard deviation of the vector c(1.4, 3.6, 7.9, 8.8)."
  CorrectAnswer: args(remainder)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='args(remainder)')
  Hint: "The function for standard deviation is called sd(). Make sure that when
    you pass a function as an argument you pass the
    name of the function without parentheses!"
