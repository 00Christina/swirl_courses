  Author: David Kane
  Type: Coursera
  Organization: Williams College
  Version: 0.1.1

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and begin to explore the relationship between your workspace and the file system of your machine.

- Class: text
  Output: Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across machines.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special functions work!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory.
  CorrectAnswer: getwd()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='getwd()')
  Hint: Type getwd() to determine the current working directory.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Show all the objects in your local workspace.
  CorrectAnswer: ls()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
  Hint: Type ls() to view all the objects in your local workspace.

- Class: text
  Output: Some R commands are the same as the Unix equivalents. Another reason why learning Unix is a good idea.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Show all the files in your working directory.
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='list.files()')
  Hint: Type list.files() to all the files in your working directory.

- Class: text
  Output: As we go through this lesson, you should be consider examining the help page for each new function. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Pull up the help for for list.files()?
  CorrectAnswer: ?list.files
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?list.files')
  Hint: Type ?list.files to retrieve the help file for list.files.


- Class: text
  Output: One of the most helpful parts of any R help file is the See Also section. Read that section for list.files. These are some of the functions we will be using in later portions of this lesson.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Show all the files in your working directory, including their full paths.
  CorrectAnswer: list.files(full.names = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='list.files(full.names = TRUE)')
  Hint: Type list.files(full.names = TRUE) to show all the files in your working directory, including their full paths.

- Class: text
  Output: Using the arg() function on a function name is also a handy way to see what arguments a function can take. 


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the arg() function to determine the arguments to list.files()?
  CorrectAnswer: arg(list.files)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='arg(list.files)')
  Hint: Type arg(list.files) to see the arguments to list.files.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir".
  CorrectAnswer: old.dir <- getwd()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='old.dir <- getwd()')
  Hint: Type old.dir <- getwd() to sAssign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir".

- Class: text
  Output: We will use old.dir at the end of these questions to move back to the place that we started. A lot of query functions like getwd() have the useful property that they return the answer to the question as a result of the function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir".
  CorrectAnswer: dir.create("testdir")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dir.create("testdir")')
  Hint: Type dir.create("testdir") to create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir".

- Class: text
  Output: We will do all our work in this new directory and then delete it after we are done. This is the R analog to "Take only pictures, leave only footprints."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Change your working directory to "testdir".
  CorrectAnswer: setwd("testdir")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='setwd("testdir")')
  Hint: Use setwd("testdir") to change your working directory to "testdir".

- Class: text
  Output: In general, you will want your working directory to be someplace sensible, perhaps created for the specific project that you are working on. In fact, organizing your work in R packages using R Studio is an excellent option. But those topics are beyond the scope of this lesson.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a file in your working directory called "mytest.R". (Note that we purposely word these questions in such a way that a web search should lead you to the appropriate R command. In this case, searching for "R create file" should work well.)
  CorrectAnswer: file.create("mytest.R")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='file.create("mytest.R")')
  Hint: file.create("mytest.R") will get the job done!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: This should be the only file in this newly created directory. What R command (that we have already covered) will conform this?
  CorrectAnswer: list.files()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='list.files()')
  Hint: list.files() shows that the directory only contains mytest.R.

- Class: text
  Output:  Confirm that by running list.files().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The result is a list, since lapply() always returns a list. Each element of this list is of length one, so the result can be simplified to a vector by calling sapply() instead of lapply(). Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: sapply(flag_colors, sum)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sapply(flag_colors, sum)')
  Hint: Use sapply(flag_colors, sum) to return a vector of column sums.

- Class: text
  Output: Perhaps it's more informative to find the proportion of flags (out of 194) containing each color. Since each column is just a bunch of 1s and 0s, the arithmetic mean of each column will give us the proportion of 1s. (If it's not clear why, think of a simpler situation where you have three 1s and two 0s -- (1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0)/5 = 3/5 = 0.6).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use sapply() to apply the mean() function to each column of flag_colors. Remember that the second argument to sapply() should just specify the name of the function (i.e. mean) that you want to apply.
  CorrectAnswer: sapply(flag_colors, mean)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sapply(flag_colors, mean)')
  Hint: sapply(flag_colors, mean) will do the trick!

- Class: text
  Output: In the examples we've looked at so far, sapply() has been able to simplify the result to vector. That's because each element of the list returned by lapply() was a vector of length one. Recall that sapply() instead returns a matrix when each element of the list returned by lapply() is a vector of the same length (> 1).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To illustrate this, let's extract columns 19 through 23 from the flags dataset and store the result in a new data frame called flag_shapes. flag_shapes <- flags[, 19:23] will do it.
  CorrectAnswer: flag_shapes <- flags[, 19:23]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='flag_shapes <- flags[, 19:23]')
  Hint: flag_shapes <- flags[, 19:23] will save columns 19 through 23 in a new variable.

- Class: text
  Output: Each of these columns (i.e. variables) represents the number of times a particular shape or design appears on a country's flag. We are interested in the minimum and maximum number of times each shape or design appears.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The range() function returns the minimum and maximum of its first argument, which should be a numeric vector. Use lapply() to apply the range function to each column of flag_shapes. Don't worry about storing the result in a new variable. By now, we know that lapply() always returns a list.
  CorrectAnswer: lapply(flag_shapes, range)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='lapply(flag_shapes, range)')
  Hint: Try lapply(flag_shapes, range) to apply the range() function to each column of flag_shapes.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Do the same operation, but using sapply() and store the result in a variable called shape_mat.
  CorrectAnswer: shape_mat <- sapply(flag_shapes, range)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='shape_mat <- sapply(flag_shapes, range)')
  Hint: shape_mat <- sapply(flag_shapes, range) will apply the range() function to each column of flag_shapes and store the result in shape_mat.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: View the contents of shape_mat.
  CorrectAnswer: shape_mat
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('shape_mat', 'print(shape_mat)')
  Hint: Type shape_mat to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: Each column of shape_mat gives the minimum (row 1) and maximum (row 2) number of times its respective shape appears in different flags.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the class() function to confirm that shape_mat is a matrix.
  CorrectAnswer: class(shape_mat)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(shape_mat)')
  Hint: class(shape_mat) returns the class of shape_mat.

- Class: text
  Output: As we've seen, sapply() always attempts to simplify the result given by lapply(). It has been successful in doing so for each of the examples we've looked at so far. Let's look at an example where sapply() can't figure out how to simplify the result and thus returns a list, no different from lapply().

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: When given a vector, the unique() function returns a vector with all duplicate elements removed. In other words, unique() returns a vector of only the 'unique' elements. To see how it works, try unique(c(3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6)).
  CorrectAnswer: unique(c(3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='unique(c(3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6))')
  Hint: Do unique(c(3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6)) to see how the unique() function works.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We want to know the unique values for each variable in the flags dataset. To accomplish this, use lapply() to apply the unique() function to each column in the flags dataset, storing the result in a variable called unique_vals.
  CorrectAnswer: unique_vals <- lapply(flags, unique)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='unique_vals <- lapply(flags, unique)')
  Hint: Try unique_vals <- lapply(flags, unique).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print the value of unique_vals to the console.
  CorrectAnswer: unique_vals
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('unique_vals', 'print(unique_vals)')
  Hint: Type unique_vals to view its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Since unique_vals is a list, you can use what you've learned to determine the length of each element of unique_vals (i.e. the number of unique values for each variable). Simplify the result, if possible. Hint: Apply the length() function to each element of unique_vals."
  CorrectAnswer: sapply(unique_vals, length)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sapply(unique_vals, length)')
  Hint: Apply the length() function to each element of the unique_vals list using sapply(). Remember, no parentheses after the name of the function you are applying (i.e. length).

- Class: text
  Output: The fact that the elements of the unique_vals list are all vectors of *different* length poses a problem for sapply(), since there's no obvious way of simplifying the result.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use sapply() to apply the unique() function to each column of the flags dataset to see that you get the same unsimplified list that you got from lapply().
  CorrectAnswer: sapply(flags, unique)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sapply(flags, unique)')
  Hint: Use sapply(flags, unique) to apply the unique function to each column of flags, failing to simplify the result.

- Class: text
  Output: Occasionally, you may need to apply a function that is not yet defined, thus requiring you to write your own. Writing functions in R is beyond the scope of this lesson, but let's look at a quick example of how you might do so in the context of loop functions.

- Class: text
  Output: Pretend you are interested in only the second item from each element of the unique_vals list that you just created. Since each element of the unique_vals list is a vector and we're not aware of any built-in function in R that returns the second element of a vector, we will construct our own function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: lapply(unique_vals, function(elem) elem[2]) will return a list containing the second item from each element of the unique_vals list. Note that our function takes one argument, elem, which is just a 'dummy variable' that takes on the value of each element of unique_vals, in turn.
  CorrectAnswer: lapply(unique_vals, function(elem) elem[2])
  AnswerTests: calculates_same_value('lapply(unique_vals, function(elem) elem[2])')
  Hint: Use lapply(unique_vals, function(elem) elem[2]) to return a list containing the second item from each element of the unique_vals list.

- Class: text
  Output: The only difference between previous examples and this one is that we are defining and using our own function right in the call to lapply(). Our function has no name and disappears as soon as lapply() is done using it. So-called 'anonymous functions' can be very useful when one of R's built-in functions isn't an option.
