  Output: To fix ideas, we will work with simple data frames. Our main goal is to introduce various plotting functions and their arguments. All the output would look better with larger, more complex data sets.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Pull up the help page for cars
  CorrectAnswer: ?cars
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ls()')
